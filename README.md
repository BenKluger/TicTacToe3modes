# TicTacToe3modes
A tic tac toe game with three modes: Player vs Player, Player vs Dumb AI, and Player vs Smart AI

The Player vs Dumb AI mode should have the computer make a random move each turn, unless the user is about to win, in which case it will block the move.
The Player cs Smart AI mode should have the computer always win or tie. It is impossible to beat it. Uses the Minimax algorithm.
